# Ethereum Client dApp - Metana week5

### 1st chart - ERC20 logs

`--> Monitor the logs of an arbitrary ERC20 token address you provide.`
`--> For each block that passes, plot the total volume of the transfers (if any). Test this on more popular ERC20 tokens.`

### 2nd chart

`--> The BASEFEE of each block. So the X-axis is the block number, and the Y-axis is the BASEFEE. If you aren’t sure what that is, watch the Gas Savings EIP 1559 video.`

### 3rd chart

`--> The ratio of gasUsed over gasLimit (plot this as a percentage).`
