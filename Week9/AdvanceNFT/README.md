## Advanced NFT

DONE -The NFT should use a state machine to determine if it is mints can happen, the presale is active, or the public sale is active, or the supply has run out. Require statements should only depend on the state (except when checking input validity)

-Implement a merkle tree airdrop where addresses in the merkle tree are allowed to mint once.

-Measure the gas cost of using a mapping to track if an address already minted vs tracking each address with a bit in a bitmap. -Hint: the merkle leaf should be the hash of the address and its index in the bitmap.
-Use the bitmaps from OpenZeppelin

DONE -Use commit reveal to allocate NFT ids randomly. The reveal should be 10 blocks ahead of the commit.

CAN'T BE DONE -Add multicall to the NFT so people can transfer several NFTs in one transaction (make sure people canâ€™t abuse minting!)
--> ??? Multicall only works for view functions, can't transfer NFTs from what I understood

DONE -Designated address should be able to withdraw funds using the pull pattern. You should be able to withdraw to an arbitrary number of contributors

## Flow of the private mint

- the user will need to set the commit calling setYourCommit(hash)
- the user has a time frame of between 2 minutes and 42 minutes to verify the commit and get the allocation of the tokenId
- after all the NFTs are minted, and the state == CLAIM_NFT, the users will be able to claim their NFTs
