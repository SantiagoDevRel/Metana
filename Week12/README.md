## Week 12

#### The structure of a transaction

-Nonce

-Gas price

-Gas limit

-Recipient

-Value

-Data

-v,r,s

Other data that can be added by the client software can be the block number and "from" (this can be derived by the v,r,s) and tx hash (can be derived by the transaction information but is not part of the content of a transaction)
